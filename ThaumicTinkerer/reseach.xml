This wand can carry 500 vis, unlike the Wand of the Adept. It's not a very dispendious item either. The downside of being forced to store more vis, is that it recharges slower in comparison to it's counterpart, the Wand of the Adept.</page>

Doing such, however, comes with a few drawbacks. The sword loses it's ability to propel nearby foes, or slow your fall, not to mention that this flight is hard to control. However, by reinforcing the sword with extra Thaumium, it became extremely resistent.</page>
